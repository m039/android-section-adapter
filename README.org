* About
  Currently this project contains two classes: SectionAdapter and
  SectionListView.

  With SectionAdapter you can create grouped or sectioned or separeted
  listview.

  And with the SectionListView you can create the list looks like iOS,
  with pinned header above.

* Notice
  This project runs only with android-11 and above.

  BTW SectionAdapter.java could be compiled with lower versions, but it
  isn't my goal.

  *And* now there is another issue with the performance in fling event.

* Usage
  Instead of documenting source code I created the demo project, try
  to look at it in /demo/ folder.

  The usage of adapter is extremely simple, but I'll try to make it
  more simple:

#+BEGIN_SRC java
   new SectionAdapter() {
          // one for sections
          public Adapter createMainSectionAdapter() {
                return ...;
          }

          // each for section
          public Adapter createSectionAdapter(Object s) {
                return ...;
          }
  };
#+END_SRC

  And example of the listener:
  
#+BEGIN_SRC java
    new AdapterView.OnItemClickListener() {
            public void onItemClick (AdapterView<?> parent, View view, int position, long id) {
                SectionAdapter a = (SectionAdapter) parent.getAdapter();

                String msg =  "Click on position: " + position +
                    ", section: " + a.getSection(position) + 
                    ", item: " + a.getItem(position);
                
                Toast.makeText(c, msg , Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
            }
        }  
#+END_SRC
